![FlapJack Cogs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptoast/freecodecamp/master/portfolio/img/flapjackcogs_sm.png "FlapJack Cogs")

A collection of cogs I have developed for Red Bot.  

- **Bigmoji** - Uploads a large .png image of an emoji.
- **ColorMe** - Allows users to manage the color of their own name through custom roles with default permissions.
- **Comics** - Fetches a random comic from a number of popular online comic sources.
- **Defcon** - A nod to the 1983 film War Games. Maintain a DEFCON system on your server, displayed through creative use of embeds.
- **Dongers** - Fetches and prints a random Donger from www.dongerlist.com.
- **Msgvote** - Turn a Discord channel into a Reddit thread... if that's something you're into...
- **ReactPoll** - Functions exactly like Red's built-in polls, but uses numeric reactions instead of typed responses.
- **SmartReact** - Set up automatic emoji reactions to specific words in chat. Like trigger, but with emojis.
- **Smite** - Smite statistics using the official Smite API.
- **Spoiler** - Hide spoilers in chat. Users can react to the spoiler message to receive the content.
- **Wat** - Assist users who have trouble 'hearing' what people type! :)
- **Wordclouds** - Create wordclouds from text channel content.

Currently disabled/hidden cogs until further work is done:

- **Blizzard** - Fetches and prints latest patch notes and some (limited) user data from current Blizzard games.
- **CryptoPrice** - Fetches cryptocurrency price data.
